# Image Processing and Caption Generation

This project automates the processing of images, including converting image formats, generating captions, embedding IPTC metadata, and removing temporary or backup files. The process is designed for efficient image handling in workflows like bulk image processing for content creation.

## Features

- **Convert images to JPEG format**: Handles PNG, JPG, and JPEG files by converting non-JPEG images to a standard JPEG format.
- **Generate captions using AI**: Leverages a pre-trained model (BLIP) to generate descriptive captions for images.
- **Refine captions**: Removes redundant phrases and ensures SEO-friendly descriptions.
- **Embed IPTC metadata**: Adds descriptive metadata to images, including title, description, and keywords.
- **Cleanup**: Automatically removes backup files and processed images from the input folder.

## Requirements

Before running this program, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.7 or higher**
- **Pillow** (for image manipulation)
- **transformers** (for the BLIP caption model)
- **iptcinfo3** (for embedding IPTC metadata)

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install Pillow transformers iptcinfo3
Setup
Clone or download the repository: If you haven't already, clone the repository or download the code to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-captioning-project.git
Prepare your input and output folders:

Create an input_folder where you will place your images. This is the folder the program will scan for images to process.
Create an output_folder where the processed images will be saved.
Configure paths: Open the script and set the paths for your input and output folders:

python
Copy code
input_folder = "input_folder"  # Replace with the path to your input folder
output_folder = "output_folder"  # Replace with the path to your output folder
Usage
To run the program, simply execute the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python process_images.py
What the Script Does
Converts Images: Any PNG images found in the input folder are converted to JPEG format.
Generates Captions: The program uses the BLIP model to generate captions for the images.
Refines Captions: The captions are cleaned up to remove redundancy and make them SEO-friendly.
Embeds IPTC Metadata: It embeds the generated caption as IPTC metadata (title, description, keywords) into the image.
Saves Processed Images: The processed image is saved in the output folder with a descriptive name based on the caption.
Cleans Up: The program removes any unnecessary backup files and deletes the original images from the input folder once they have been processed.
Logging
The program logs every major step, including any errors, so you can track the progress and diagnose issues if they arise. Logs are written to the console by default.

To enable more verbose logging, you can adjust the logging level in the script:

python
Copy code
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)  # Change to DEBUG for more detailed logs
Configuration
Customizing Captioning
If you want to adjust how captions are generated, you can modify the generate_caption and refine_caption functions to tweak how the captions are processed.

File Cleanup
The remove_backup_files function ensures that any temporary or backup files (such as files ending with ~) are removed after processing. You can disable this behavior by commenting out the function call in the process_images function.

Metadata Fields
The IPTC metadata is added to each image with the following fields:

Object Name: The title generated from the caption
Caption/Abstract: The full caption generated for the image
Keywords: A list of keywords derived from the title
You can modify the metadata structure by updating the embed_iptc_metadata function.

Example Workflow
Input:
A folder named input_folder containing images like image1.png, image2.jpg, etc.
Output:
The processed images will be saved in output_folder with descriptive filenames like A_beautiful_sunset.jpg.
IPTC metadata will be embedded in the images, and the original files from the input folder will be removed.
Troubleshooting
1. "Error converting to JPEG"
Ensure that the file is a valid image. This error can occur if the image is corrupt or not supported.
2. "Error embedding IPTC metadata"
Check if the image is in a supported format for IPTC metadata embedding (JPEG or TIFF are recommended).
3. Missing Dependencies
If any dependencies are missing, ensure you've installed them via pip install Pillow transformers iptcinfo3.
